## 🌱 My Journey as a Developer

I started my journey in tech by diving deep into backend development, focusing on creating APIs and handling complex data structures. Over time, I became fascinated with containerization tools like **Docker** and orchestration platforms like **Kubernetes**, which allow applications to scale efficiently.  

Today, I specialize in building high-performance backend systems, managing cloud infrastructures, and implementing CI/CD pipelines. My current focus is on mastering advanced backend architectures and optimizing server-side performance for cloud-native applications.  

The world of backend development is constantly evolving, and I’m excited to keep learning and growing! ✨
